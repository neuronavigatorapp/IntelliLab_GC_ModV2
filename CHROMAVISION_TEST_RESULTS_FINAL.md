## Detailed Test Results

### Test 1: Good Quality ASTM D2163 Analysis

**Status:** âœ… **SUCCESS**  
**Response Time:** 2.07 seconds  
**Peak Count:** 156 peaks detected  
**Quality Grade:** B (Fair) - 66.9% overall quality score  

#### AI Analysis Summary:
- **Baseline Quality:** Fair
- **Noise Level:** 0.056 (5.6%)
- **Primary Issue:** Peak tailing detected
- **Confidence Level:** High (85%)

#### Key AI Recommendations:
**Troubleshooting Suggestions:**
- âœ“ Peak tailing observed - check injection port liner condition
- âœ“ Consider reducing injection volume or sample concentration  
- âœ“ Verify column installation and connections
- âœ“ Peak fronting detected - sample overload likely
- âœ“ Reduce injection volume or dilute sample
- âœ“ Check for active sites in injection port

**Method Optimization:**
- âœ“ Consider using a slower temperature ramp for better separation
- âœ“ Peaks appear broad - consider increasing carrier gas flow rate
- âœ“ Use splitless injection for better sensitivity
- âœ“ Optimize injection port temperature for your analytes

#### Peak Shape Analysis:
- **Good Quality Peaks:** 87% of detected peaks
- **Tailing Peaks:** 9% showing asymmetry issues
- **Fronting Peaks:** 4% indicating overload conditions

**Status:** âœ… **SUCCESS**  
**Response Time:** 2.05 seconds  
**Peak Count:** 194 peaks detected  
**Quality Grade:** C (Needs Improvement) - Estimated <60% quality score

#### AI Analysis Summary:
- **Baseline Quality:** Poor (severe drift detected)
- **Noise Level:** High electronic interference
- **Primary Issue:** Multiple systematic problems
- **Confidence Level:** High (85%)

#### System Performance Validation:
âœ“ **Correctly identified problematic baseline drift**  
âœ“ **Detected poor peak resolution issues**  
âœ“ **Recognized peak shape problems (tailing/fronting)**  
âœ“ **Identified potential detector saturation**  
âœ“ **Suggested appropriate corrective actions**
