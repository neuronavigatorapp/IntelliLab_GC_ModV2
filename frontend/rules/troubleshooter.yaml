# LPG/NG, vapor loop, rotary valve, FID/TCD – neutral wording
version: 1
checks:
  - id: early_tailing
    when: "any_peak.tailing_factor > 1.5 and any_peak.rt < 3.0"
    ask: "Is split flow stable (±5%) for 2 minutes after injection?"
    if_yes:
      advise:
        - "Inspect/replace inlet liner; check for active sites."
        - "Reduce inlet temperature by 10–20 °C and re-check tailing."
    if_no:
      advise:
        - "Suspect split-vent restriction. Inspect split vent path and trap."
        - "Simulate lower split ratio and confirm area response."
  - id: baseline_rise_backflush
    when: "baseline.slope_increase and near(method.backflush_start, 0.3)"
    advise:
      - "Move backflush start earlier by 0.2–0.5 min and re-run."
      - "Check bleed/contamination on post-column path."
  - id: c3_c4_coelution
    when: "coelution('C3','C4', threshold=0.08)"
    advise:
      - "Add 0.2–0.5 min hold before ramp or reduce ramp rate by 2–4 °C/min."
      - "Simulate alternate oven step and confirm ΔRT > 0.1 min."
