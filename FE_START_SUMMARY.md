# Frontend Start Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPILED BUT ❌ SERVER NOT RUNNING

### Compilation Results
- **Status**: Webpack compiled successfully with warnings
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (react-scripts 5.0.1)
- **Warnings**: ESLint warnings only (TypeScript `any` types and React hooks dependencies)
- **Fatal Errors**: None detected

### Issue Analysis: **Bucket A - CRA Preflight / Runtime Issue**

The compilation succeeded but the development server failed to bind to a port and serve content.

### Symptoms Observed
1. ✅ Webpack compilation completed
2. ✅ All TypeScript files processed
3. ❌ No "Local: http://localhost:3000" message
4. ❌ No listening socket on port 3000
5. ❌ Process exits after compilation

### Version Analysis
- **Node.js**: v24.7.0 ✅ (Compatible with CRA 5)
- **npm**: 11.5.1 ✅
- **react-scripts**: 5.0.1 ✅
- **ESLint**: 8.57.1 ✅ (Compatible with CRA 5)
- **TypeScript**: 4.9.5 ⚠️ (Older - CRA 5 prefers 5.3-5.4)

### Likely Root Cause
**TypeScript Version Mismatch**: CRA 5.0.1 has known issues with TypeScript 4.9.x. The development server may fail to start properly due to internal TypeScript compiler API changes.

### Evidence
- Compilation succeeds (TypeScript compiles correctly)
- Webpack builds bundle successfully  
- Development server fails to bind/serve (runtime issue)
- Exit code 1 after "webpack compiled" message

### Proposed Fix
**Single Version Pin**: Upgrade TypeScript to ~5.4 for better CRA 5 compatibility

**One-line diff proposal**:
```diff
- "typescript": "^4.9.5"
+ "typescript": "~5.4.0"
```

### Alternative Temporary Diagnostic
Add to `frontend/.env`:
```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```
This will bypass CRA's preflight checks to confirm the server can start, then remove after version alignment.
