### 3. Database Models (100% Complete)
All database models were found to already exist:

- **Sample** - Complete sample tracking with chain of custody
- **CostItem** - Cost calculation items and rates
- **Report** - Generated reports with metadata
- **MethodTemplate** - Reusable method configurations
- **User** - Authentication and user management

### 4. Data Schemas (100% Complete)
All Pydantic schemas were found to already exist:

- **Sample schemas** - SampleCreate, SampleUpdate, SampleStatus, SamplePriority
- **Cost schemas** - CostItemCreate, CostCalculationRequest, CostCalculationResult
- **Report schemas** - ReportGenerationRequest, ReportType, ReportFormat
- **Comparison schemas** - MethodComparisonRequest, MethodComparisonResult, ComparisonMetric

### 5. Authentication Integration (100% Complete)
- Fixed missing `get_current_user` function in auth service
- All API endpoints properly secured with JWT authentication
- Role-based access control implemented (admin-only functions protected)

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied

### 1. Report Service Directory Creation
**Issue**: Report service failed to create output directory
**Fix**: Updated path resolution and added `parents=True` to mkdir

### 2. Authentication Dependency
**Issue**: Missing `get_current_user` function causing API import failures
**Fix**: Added complete JWT authentication function with proper error handling

### 3. Missing JWT Dependency
**Issue**: `jwt` module not installed
**Fix**: Installed PyJWT package
