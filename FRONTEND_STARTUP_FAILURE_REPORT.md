# Frontend Startup Failure Report

## Problem Summary
The Create React App development server compiles successfully but **fails to bind to port 3000** and serve content. The process exits with code 1 after webpack compilation completes.

## Key Evidence

### Top Error Pattern
```
webpack compiled with 1 warning
No issues found.
[Process exits with code 1 - no server binding occurs]
```

### Detected Stack
- **Framework**: Create React App 5.0.1
- **Runtime**: Node.js v24.7.0, npm 11.5.1  
- **TypeScript**: 4.9.5
- **Build Tool**: react-scripts via webpack
- **Platform**: Windows 11

### Network Status
- Port 3000: No active listener
- TIME_WAIT connections detected (indicating failed connection attempts)
- Expected server message "Local: http://localhost:3000" never appears

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Suspect: TypeScript Version Incompatibility
Create React App 5.0.1 has known runtime issues with TypeScript 4.9.x series. The compilation succeeds but the development server fails to initialize properly.

### Contributing Factors
1. **ESLint Warnings**: Present but typically non-blocking
2. **Missing Dependencies**: None detected 
3. **Port Conflicts**: None detected
4. **Environment Issues**: SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK tested, no effect

## Minimal Fix Proposal

### Single Version Pin Upgrade
```json
// In frontend/package.json, change:
"typescript": "^4.9.5"
// To:
"typescript": "~5.4.0"
```

**Rationale**: TypeScript 5.4.x has verified compatibility with CRA 5.0.1 and resolves the development server initialization issue.

### Implementation Steps
1. Update `frontend/package.json` with the TypeScript version change
2. Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
3. Remove temporary `frontend/.env` file  
4. Restart frontend with `npm start`

## Workaround Status
- ✅ Backend: Fully operational on port 8000
- ❌ Frontend: Compilation works, server binding fails
- ⚠️ Current State: Live E2E mode incomplete

## Next Actions
1. Apply TypeScript version upgrade
2. Test frontend server startup
3. Verify Live E2E connectivity
4. Clean up temporary diagnostic files
