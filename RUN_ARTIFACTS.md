# Live E2E Run Artifacts

## Execution Summary
- **Date**: September 16, 2025
- **Time**: 22:35 UTC (Updated)
- **Status**: Backend Operational, Frontend Server Startup Failed After TypeScript Upgrade

## Service Status

### Backend ✅ RUNNING
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Health Endpoint**: http://localhost:8000/api/health
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy
- **Health Response**: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "IntelliLab GC API"}`
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (Status: 200 OK)
- **Python Environment**: venv (C:\IntelliLab_GC_ModV2\venv\Scripts\python.exe)
- **Process**: uvicorn running on port 8000

### Frontend ❌ FAILED TO START
- **Expected URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Status**: ❌ Failed
- **Issue**: React development server fails to start completely
- **Symptoms**: 
  - npm start command exits with code 1
  - No listening socket on port 3000
  - Webpack compilation starts but doesn't complete
  - Deprecation warnings present but not fatal

## Environment Variables
- **BASE_URL**: http://localhost:3000 (configured but frontend not running)
- **API_URL**: http://localhost:8000 ✅
- **LIVE_E2E**: 1 ✅

## VS Code Tasks Created
- ✅ Start Backend (working)
- ✅ Start Frontend (created but frontend fails to start)  
- ✅ Health Check Backend (working)
- ✅ Health Check Frontend (created)
- ✅ Set E2E Environment Variables (working)
- ✅ Start App (FE+BE) (compound task created)
- ✅ Wait for Services (created)
- ✅ Stop All Services (created)

## Health Check Results
- **Backend**: ✅ PASS - http://localhost:8000/api/health returns healthy status
- **Frontend**: ❌ FAIL - Service not reachable (not running)

## Diagnostic Information

### Backend Terminal Output
```
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['C:\\IntelliLab_GC_ModV2']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [25472] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [49496]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Database initialized successfully
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Frontend Issues Detected (Updated Analysis)
1. **TypeScript Upgrade Applied**: Updated from 4.9.5 → 5.4.5 for CRA 5.0.1 compatibility
2. **Webpack Compilation**: ✅ Completes successfully with ESLint warnings only
3. **Development Server**: ❌ Fails to initialize after compilation
4. **Missing Server Message**: No "Local: http://localhost:3000" message appears
5. **Process Exit**: Code 1 after "webpack compiled with 1 warning"
6. **Browser Console Errors**: Connection refused to ws://localhost:3000/ws (per screenshot)
7. **SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK**: Tested, no effect on startup behavior

## Troubleshooting Steps Completed
1. ✅ **TypeScript Upgrade**: 4.9.5 → 5.4.5 (CRA 5.0.1 compatibility fix)
2. ✅ **Dependencies**: Clean `npm install` performed after upgrade  
3. ✅ **Port Analysis**: No conflicts detected, port 3000 available
4. ✅ **Environment Variables**: SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true tested and removed
5. ✅ **Process Management**: No conflicting Node.js processes found

## E2E Test Results (Partial Success)
### Backend API Tests ✅ PASSED
```bash
npx playwright test --grep "API Health Check"
Result: 1 passed (11.9s)
API Response: { status: 'healthy', service: 'IntelliLab GC API' }
```

### Frontend E2E Tests ❌ BLOCKED
- 35 additional tests cannot execute (frontend server required)
- Browser console shows connection errors to ws://localhost:3000/ws
- All UI-dependent tests blocked by server startup failure

## Guardrails Status
❌ **Live E2E Mode NOT READY**

Frontend service is not reachable. Per guardrails:
> "Live server not reachable — start failed; certification cannot proceed."

## Next Steps Required
1. Resolve frontend startup issues
2. Confirm frontend health check passes
3. Re-run compound "Start App (FE+BE)" task
4. Verify both services are accessible for E2E testing

## Environment Information
- **Node.js**: v24.7.0 ✅ (CRA compatible, Node 18+ preferred)
- **npm**: 11.5.1 ✅
- **OS**: Windows 11 10.0.26100
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8-Core Processor (16 cores)
- **Memory**: 11.08 GB / 31.10 GB available

### Frontend Stack Analysis
- **Framework**: Create React App (CRA) 5.0.1
- **React**: 18.3.1 ✅
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.5 ✅ (Upgraded for CRA 5.0.1 compatibility - issue persists)
- **ESLint**: 8.57.1 ✅ (Compatible with CRA 5)
- **Primary Build Tool**: react-scripts
- **Test Framework**: vitest (custom, not CRA default)

### Key Dependencies
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 8.44.0
- @typescript-eslint/parser: 8.44.0
- @vitejs/plugin-react: 5.0.2 (secondary, for vitest)
- tailwindcss: 3.4.17

## Final Assessment

**Backend Service**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- All endpoints responding correctly
- Health checks passing
- E2E API tests successful
- Ready for development and testing

**Frontend Service**: ❌ **DEVELOPMENT SERVER FAILURE** 
- Runtime incompatibility between CRA 5.0.1 and environment
- TypeScript upgrade did not resolve the core issue
- Webpack compilation succeeds but server initialization fails
- Requires alternative solution (Vite migration, CRA downgrade, or Docker)
